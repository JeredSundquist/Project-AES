Trackable Web Api Patterns ReadMe

Follow these steps to use the Web API project template.

1. Reverse engineer service entities.
   - Right-click on the ServiceEntities project, select EntityFramework,
	 Reverse Engineer Code First.
	 > Enter a server name (for example, .\sqlexpress)
	 > Select a database
   - This will generate a DbContext-derived class, mapping classes,
	 and entities using the supplied code templates.
	 > Entities will implement the ITrackable interface

2. Copy the connection string from the App.config file in the
   ServiceEntities project, and paste it into the ConnectionString
   section of the web.config file in the Web API project.

3. Configure IoC Container
   - Open SimpleInjectorWebApiInitializer.cs in the App_Start folder
	 > Register context, unit of work and repos with per request lifetime

4. Press Ctrl+F5 to launch the Web API service
   - Click the API link to see a description of controllers and actions
   - Click the Test API button to execute an action.
	 > Add parameters and/or a body as needed, then click Send
