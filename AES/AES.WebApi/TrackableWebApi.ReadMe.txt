Trackable Web Api ReadMe

Follow these steps to use the Web API project template.

1. Reverse engineer service entities.
   - Right-click on the ServiceEntities project, select EntityFramework,
     Reverse Engineer Code First.
	 > Enter a server name (for example, .\sqlexpress)
	 > Select a database
   - This will generate a DbContext-derived class, mapping classes,
     and entities using the supplied code templates.
	 > Entities will implement the ITrackable interface

2. Copy the connection string from the App.config file in the
   ServiceEntities project, and paste it into the ConnectionString
   section of the web.config file in the Web API project.

3. Add an API controller (right-click the Controllers folder)
   - For the template select:
     API controller with read/write actions, using Entity Framework
   - Select a class from the Service.Entities project as the model
   - Select a Data context derived class from the ServiceEntities project
     > The generated API controller will include actions which leverage
       trackable entitites for persistence of an entire object graph.
     > Get, Post and Delete actions will mostly be the same, but the Put
       action will include code which calls the ApplyChanges extension
       method on DbContext in order to update the object graph entity state
       based on the TrackingState property of each entity.
     > Delete action can have a TODO item for setting the concurrency property
       of the new entity from the parameter entity.

4. Press Ctrl+F5 to launch the Web API service
   - Click the API link to see a description of controllers and actions
   - Click the Test API button to execute an action.\
     > Add parameters and/or a body as needed, then click Send
