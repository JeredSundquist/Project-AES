Trackable Service .NET 4.5 Shared Entities ReadMe

NOTE: You can reverse engineer entities either using the Entity Framework
Power Tools or the Entity Framework 6.x Tools for Visual Studio.

This project can be referenced by both client and service projects.
This project template functions as a Data Access Layer and can be
referenced either by a Repositories class library or directly by
an ASP.NET Web API or WCF project.

Custom T4 templates are provided for reverse engineering a 
database to generate Code First classes with fluent API and entities
that implement the ITrackable interface from the TrackingEntitites
NuGet packages.

To get started, just right-click on the project produced by the
template, select Add New Item, Data, ADO.NET Entity Data Model.
Select or create a data connection. The tool will generate Code First
entities based on the T4 templates located in the project.

After running the tool, you will need to copy the connection string
from App.config into the web.config (or app.config) file of the
service host.

You can also use the EF 6.x Tools for Visual Studio to generate entities
using either "Code First from Database" or "EF Designer from Database."
With the Code First option, you may need to insert a partial DbContext
class with a partial ModelBuilding method, in order to add mappings for
one-to-one relations.  For example:

public partial class NorthwindSlim
{
    partial void ModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<CustomerSetting>()
            .HasKey(e => e.CustomerId);
    }
}
